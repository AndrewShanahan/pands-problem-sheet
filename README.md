# Student/Author: Andrew Shanahan
# Assignment: Programming & Scripting Problem Sheet

# Summary:
# ========
# This readme file contains description of the author along with information on the course, school and module.
# The PandS Problem Sheet contained 8 weekly task covering the topics that were introduced as part of this course.

# Materials and Sources:
# =======================
# Materials and sources used on a regular basis to source information and inspiration and all of the problems on this assignement were as follows:

# 1. Course lectures and supporting information provided by lecturer
# 2. https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp - This was a valuable resource which gave good guidance along the way to support the lecture material and give the foundations on what I would use in my code.
# 3. https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science
# 4. https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-data-science-in-python
# The Datacamp courses were used as a supplentary resource to backup the information learned from the course lectures. I was fortunate enough to have access to Datacamp through my employer.
# 5. Reddit, there are a number of dedicated reddit pages that I frequently used in order to find other users experiences and what resourses other reddit users advised. From here I found a number of youtube channels, websites and forums to read/watch and gain some knownledge and insights. Unfortunately as I write this Readme file, I have lost the varrious links to the youtube channels. I found these very valuable in terms of explaining parts of the code I was attempting to write.

# Topics & Weekly tasks:
# ======================
# Topic 1 - Setting up the environment: This contained Weekly task 1 which required me to introduce myself into the discussion board on Moodle/Learn Online in addition to setting up the GitHub environment and practicing with some sample code.
# Topic 2 - Statements: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme to calculate BMI. Named: bmi.py
# Topic 3 - Varriables: This topic contained a weekly task werhe I was required to write a programme to ask a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. Named: secondstring.py
# Topic 4 - Controlling the flow: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. Named: collatz.py
# Topic 5 - Data: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. For whatever reason, I found this task the most enjoyable of all. Named: weekday.py
# Topic 6 - Functions: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. This was the most challenging task of the problem sheet. Named: squareroot.py
# Topic 7 - Files: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. This task took a lot of time and effort to research but the challenge was interesting. Named es.py
# Topic 8 - Looking ahead: This topic contained a weekly task where I was required to write a programme called plottask.py, unfortunatelly I did not complete this task however on doing research for the PandS project I covered the topics and would have been in a position to complete this at a later date
